# Make-a-Password

## Description

This project will demonstrate the proper functions of a password generator. The passwords can contain between 8 and 128 characters including upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters. A series of prompts will show for password criteria. This project has helped me learn how to include the css properties to the generator. I am still figuring out the Javascript piece but that is a work in progress.
